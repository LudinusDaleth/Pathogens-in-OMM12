# R Scripts for Plot Generation - *Comparison of Four Enteric Pathogens in OligoMM12 Mice*

Welcome to the repository containing the R scripts used in the generation of the plots featured in the paper titled **"Comparison of Four Enteric Pathogens in OligoMM12 Mice Reveals Pathogen-Specific Host and Microbiota Responses"**.

## Overview

This repository includes scripts that were instrumental in visualizing the complex data obtained from our study, which investigates the distinct host and microbiota responses to four different enteric pathogens in OligoMM12 mice. The plots generated cover various aspects of the 16S rRNA gene sequencing data, offering insights into microbial dynamics and host interactions.

### Key Scripts

- **16S Data Analysis Plots**: Scripts to generate insightful plots from 16S rRNA sequencing data, illustrating microbial composition and changes in response to pathogen colonization.
  
- **Relative Abundance Plots**: Visualize the relative abundance of various taxa across different experimental conditions, shedding light on pathogen-specific effects on the microbiota.

- **Abundance Comparison**: Detailed comparison of microbial abundances across different groups, allowing for an in-depth understanding of the shifts in microbial populations.

- **Alpha Diversity Analysis**: Explore the diversity within samples using alpha diversity metrics, revealing the impact of pathogen infection on microbial richness and evenness.
